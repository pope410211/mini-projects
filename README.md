## Javascript Projects

A sample of mini-projects such as a todo list with more to be added. Projects will be presented in `Vanillajs`, `ES6-typescript`, and possibly a framework like `Angularjs` or `Angular`.

### ToDo List
* [ ] `Vanillajs` version.
  * Javascript Decisons:
    * IIFE:
	  * I felt it was good practice, though certainly not needed for this project.
    * Inline Javascript inside HTML:
      * Personal Implementation decision to create cleaner, easier to read HTML and Javascript separately.
	* TODO: 
	  * Learn, and potentially refactor.
	* Reusable code
  * CSS:
    * TODO:
  * HTML: 
    * Will be mostly dynamic - from javascript.
  * TODO Features:
    * Mark as complete.
	* Delete.
	* Ensure empty tasks are not added.
