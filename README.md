## Javascript Projects

A sample of mini-projects such as a todo list with more to be added. Projects will be presented in `Vanillajs`, `ES6-typescript`, and possibly a framework like `Angularjs` or `Angular`.

---

### ToDo List
* [ ] `Vanillajs` version.
  * Javascript Decisons:
    * IIFE:
	  * I felt it was good practice, though certainly not needed for this project.
    * Inline Javascript inside HTML:
      * Personal Implementation decision to create cleaner, easier to read HTML and Javascript separately.
	* TODO: 
	  * Learn, and potentially refactor.
	* Reusable code
  * CSS:
    * TODO:
  * HTML: 
    * Will be mostly dynamic - from javascript.
  * TODO Features:
    * Mark as complete.
	* Delete.
	* Ensure empty tasks are not added.

  ### HTML5 Canvas
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2au9EfeRQ
    * Watching Chris Courses as a tutorial.
  * Time to do something on our own.

  #### Important Canvas Notes 
  * `Canvas/bubbles` - I followed along on every piece to learn and understand what is happening, and how it works by typing and understanding every line, and even added an eventListner on `mouseleave`.
  * `Canvas/Gravity` - As above, I did follow along, however, I used the [Canvas Boilerplate](https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate) from Chris Courses that made doing some of the features easier.
  * `Canvas/Collision` - Same as above. The code for the physics was provided, I have ready it over to understand, and it made sense, though I am in a position where I need to learn more regarding this.
